        <p>We’re a Doors tribute band based in the SF Bay Area. We play events, parties, and shows all around the bay and beyond. We’d love to bring the Doors to you! For booking, <a href="/booking">click here</a>.</p>
        <p>The magic and majesty of The Doors comes alive again, when the OPEN DOORS cast their web of music and mystery over your body and soul. A San Francisco Bay based band of five fine musicians and friends, they have captured the magic and mystery of the original Doors and can break you through to the other side. They take you for a ride with awesome color, flash, movement, and spectacular sound. Ride the snake.</p>
        <p>Its time to open up the Doors music, again. Lets open the doors of enjoyment, enlightenment and fun. There’s so much to see and hear and enjoy. The OPEN DOORS is the band that can take you there, take you where the music and the dance, and the fun are all there for you.</p>
