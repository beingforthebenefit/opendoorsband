            <h2 class="bio-subtitle">Lead singer</h2>
            <p>
                His passion for the arts has had a deep influence on his life. Since
                he was a child, he has been involved in various art forms: dance, acting,
                musicâ€”to name a few. Oscar is a Drummer musician he has been recording and
                playing in different projects along his career and trajectory for many
                years, and has been singing for a few years until now. Now he is the
                singer and founding member of the Open Doors.

            <h2 class="bio-subtitle">Bassist</h2>
            <p>
                Originally from the DC area, Nate has been living on the west coast most
                of his adult life. Growing up, he got into 60s and 70s rock, listening
                to Zeppelin, The Beatles, and of course The Doors on repeat. Since
                moving to the bay area in 2014, Nate has continued playing music. He
                served as the singer and bassist for All Day Breakfast. Most recently
                Nate has been handling bass, backing vocals, and sometimes rhythm guitar
                for Greg Hoy and The Boys who recently completed tours on both coasts.
                Now he lays down a solid foundation of killer bass to the OPEN DOORS
                musical assault on your senses.
